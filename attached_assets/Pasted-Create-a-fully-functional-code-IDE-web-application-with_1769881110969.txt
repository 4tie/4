Create a fully functional code IDE web application with the following specifications:

Build a comprehensive development environment that includes:

AI Integration Section:
- Implement AI assistance using only free models available on OpenRouter API
- Include model selection dropdown with available free models (such as Qwen, Llama variants, and other free-tier models)
- Add chat interface for AI interactions with syntax-highlighted code responses
- Integrate AI code generation, completion, and explanation features
- Store API key securely in local storage with clear option to update it
- Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

Main IDE Tab:
- Create a full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting for Python
- Implement file browser sidebar showing project structure
- Add functionality to create, open, save, and delete files
- Include tabs for multiple open files
- Implement find and replace functionality
- Add auto-indentation and bracket matching
- Include line numbers and code folding
- Support keyboard shortcuts for common operations (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+F, etc.)

Freqtrade Backtesting Tab:
- Add dedicated section for Freqtrade strategy development and testing
- Create strategy file template with proper Freqtrade structure
- Implement syntax highlighting specific to Freqtrade indicators and functions
- Add backtesting configuration panel with settings for:
  - Timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
  - Date ranges for testing
  - Initial stake amounts
  - Stop loss and take profit percentages
  - Pair selection
- Integrate backtest execution with real-time progress display
- Show console output during backtest execution

Results Tab:
- Display backtesting results in organized dashboard format
- Show key metrics: total trades, win rate, profit percentage, drawdown
- Include equity curve chart
- Display individual trade list with entry/exit prices and P&L
- Show buy/sell signal markers on price chart
- Export results to CSV format
- Include trade history timeline visualization

CLI Terminal:
- Implement command-line interface at the bottom of the application
- Support command history (up/down arrows)
- Include common commands: run backtest, validate strategy, list strategies
- Display command output with proper formatting
- Allow switching between different terminal sessions
- Add clear input field with command suggestions

Technical Requirements:
- Use React or Vue.js as frontend framework
- Implement Monaco Editor or CodeMirror for code editing
- Create RESTful API backend using Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- Store strategies and configurations in local file system
- Use Chart.js or similar library for data visualization
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
- Make the application fully functional without any mock data

The application should be ready to deploy locally with all features working including actual OpenRouter API calls, real Freqtrade backtesting execution, and genuine CLI command processing.
